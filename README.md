# Adobe Cloud Free

![Adobe Cloud Free](https://github.com/somebodyscript/adobe-cloud-free/assets/144458220/7395c473-6090-4a9b-923a-7d304d238b05)

Adobe Cloud Free is powered by some.js

Adobe Creative Cloud offers over 20 apps from Adobe, such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and more, but it requires a subscription. For this reason, there's a utility called Adobe Cloud Free (ACF) that automatically creates and activates a new account for a 7-day trial on all Adobe Creative Cloud applications. ACF uses hi2.in for temporary email services, allowing you to change your account settings at any time.

> [!Warning]
> The automatic creation and activation of Adobe accounts may violate their terms of use, use Adobe-Cloud-Free at your own risk, the author/co-authors of this repository take no responsibility. Use for research purposes only.
