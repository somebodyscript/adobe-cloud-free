# Adobe Cloud Free

![Adobe Cloud Free](https://github.com/somebodyscript/adobe-cloud-free/assets/144458220/7395c473-6090-4a9b-923a-7d304d238b05)

Adobe Cloud Free is powered by some.js

Adobe Creative Cloud offers over 20 apps from Adobe, such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, and more, but it requires a subscription. For this reason, there's a utility called Adobe Cloud Free (ACF) that automatically creates and activates a new account for a 7-day trial on all Adobe Creative Cloud applications. ACF uses hi2.in for temporary email services, allowing you to change your account settings at any time.

> [!Warning]
> The automatic creation and activation of Adobe accounts may violate their terms of use, use Adobe-Cloud-Free at your own risk, the author/co-authors of this repository take no responsibility. Use for research purposes only.

# Tips
1. Do not set the speed version to less than 5 seconds, even if you have fast Internet and a strong device. 
2. Once you complete the captcha, press Enter in the console. 
3. After creating an account, install Adobe Creative Cloud and log into the created account, and select the Adobe product, there will be a “Try” button next to it, click on it and the installation of the program will begin.
4. If you have problems, feel free to post them in Discussions or Issues, or email me.
